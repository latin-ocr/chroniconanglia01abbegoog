Tatwine died in 734, aeeording to some old authorities on the
thirtieoeh of July. ΙΙ

Tntwine must be considered as the second iu point of date
οἱ the Anglo-Latin poets⁴ His small book os AEnigmatat in
Latin hexamessers, is still preserved, ἦ] hut has not been printed,

although it is quite worthy to be placed by the side oi the ,

similar work of Aldhelm, His verses, without being remark-
able, for their excellence, are superior to those oi his coutem-
,ποι-κη’ Bede3 his expressions, it is true, nte often obscure,
buz this was perhaps n quuhty required by the subject ......

Such writings as these seem to hnve occupied the lighter
hours οἱ leisure oi the Anglo-Saxon monks, und to have been
always considered as literary umusements, nrjeuz d’esprit. The
AEuigmata of Tatwine present a similar ingenious device ιο
that which has been observed iu the prolugue to those of
Afflhelm, although ik does noe here conceal the author's name.
